            <h2>Core Beliefs of Islam (Aqidah)</h2>
            <p>Beyond practices, Islam encompasses a profound set of beliefs that shape a Muslim's worldview and connection with the Divine. These are often referred to as the "Articles of Faith."</p>

                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>Belief in Allah (God)</h3>
                    <p>The core of Islamic belief is the absolute monotheism (Tawhid) â€“ the belief in Allah, the One, incomparable God, the Creator and Sustainer of the universe. He is unique, without partners, equals, or offspring, and worthy of all worship.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>Belief in Angels</h3>
                    <p>Belief in Allah's unseen creations, the angels, who are pure, obedient beings created from light. They carry out Allah's commands and have various roles, such as delivering revelations (Jibreel/Gabriel), recording deeds, and praising Allah.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>Belief in Holy Books</h3>
                    <p>Belief in all the divine scriptures revealed by Allah to His prophets. These include the Torah (to Moses), Psalms (to David), Gospel (to Jesus), and the final and complete revelation, the Holy Quran (to Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon them all). Muslims believe the Quran is preserved in its original form.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>Belief in Prophets and Messengers</h3>
                    <p>Belief in all prophets sent by Allah throughout history, from Adam to Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and finally, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon them all). They all conveyed the same core message of submitting to One God. Muhammad is the last prophet.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>Belief in the Day of Judgment</h3>
                    <p>Belief that there will be a predetermined Day when all humanity, from the beginning of time to its end, will be resurrected and judged by Allah based on their beliefs and deeds in this life. This will determine their eternal abode in Paradise or Hellfire.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>Belief in Divine Decree (Qadar)</h3>
                    <p>Belief that Allah has perfect knowledge of all things, past, present, and future, and everything happens by His divine will and decree. This does not negate human free will; rather, it means Allah knows and wills what people will choose, while holding them accountable for their choices.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>These beliefs provide a strong foundation for a Muslim's understanding of God, humanity, and the universe, guiding their actions and intentions.</p>
