            <h2>The Five Pillars of Islam</h2>
            <p>The Five Pillars are the fundamental practices that form the foundation of Muslim life. Understanding and striving to fulfill them is crucial for every Muslim.</p>

                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>1. Shahadah (Declaration of Faith)</h3>
                    <p>The declaration that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah, and Muhammad is His messenger. This is the cornerstone of Islam, the very utterance of which enters one into the fold of Islam.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>2. Salah (Prayer)</h3>
                    <p>Performing five obligatory prayers facing the Kaaba in Mecca, at specific times of the day (dawn, noon, mid-afternoon, sunset, night). It's a direct connection with Allah, a means of purification and remembrance.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>3. Zakat (Charity)</h3>
                    <p>Obligatory charity paid annually to the poor and needy, as well as other specified recipients, by those who meet certain wealth thresholds. It purifies wealth, reduces economic disparity, and fosters social welfare.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>4. Sawm (Fasting)</h3>
                    <p>Fasting during the holy month of Ramadan from dawn until sunset, abstaining from food, drink, and intimate relations. It's a spiritual discipline that fosters self-control, empathy for the less fortunate, and gratitude.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="info-card">
                    <h3>5. Hajj (Pilgrimage)</h3>
                    <p>The pilgrimage to Mecca, obligatory once in a lifetime for every Muslim who is physically and financially able to perform it. It symbolizes unity, equality, and devotion, bringing Muslims from all corners of the world together.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Fulfilling these pillars with sincerity and understanding is a path to a stronger connection with Allah and a comprehensive Islamic life.</p>
